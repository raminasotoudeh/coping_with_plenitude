# Coping with Plenitude:  A Computational Approach to Selecting the Right Algorithm 

Here, you can find the code and analyses for the paper, "Coping with Plenitude:  A Computational Approach to Selecting the Right Algorithm", by Sotoudeh and DiMaggio, forthcoming in SMR. All of the analyses were performed in R. The core functions are described and included in the file, functions.R. The code for running the grid-search simulations is included in simulations.R. The main analyses of the grid-search results is in gridsearch_results.R. Analyses of and predictions for the empirical data can be found in empirical_analyses.R. Finally, the validation analyses are in the script validation.R. Certain scripts are dependent on the results of previous scripts and so below we suggest an order to run them:

1. functions.R
2. simulations.R
3. gridsearch_analyses.R
4. empirical_analyses.R
5. validation.R

Feel free to direct any questions you have about the code or paper to Ramina at: sotoudeh@princeton.edu
